Here is a modern rewrite of the passage in a more contemporary style:

**THE GATES OF MORNING**

**CHAPTER 1: THE CANOE BUILDER**

Dick stood on the coral ledge, gazing out at the South. The breakers of the outer sea thundered behind him, scattering spindrift on the wind. Before him, the ocean stretched calm and blue, a lake infinite and serene, with fishing gulls wheeling above. This was the lagoon of Karolin.

The calm waters were a world unto themselves, a sea of storm in heavy winds, a lake of blue in light airs. And it was all his â€“ his kingdom, his domain. He had landed here just yesterday.

Women, children, and youths all bustled along the beach in the blazing sun, fishing with nets, playing games, or working on the paraka patches. All were his people. All his the canoes drawn up on the sand, and all his the empty war canoes that rested on their rollers.

As Dick gazed out at the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow contracted. He turned his back to the lagoon, facing the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Out there, beyond the sea line, invisible, loomed Palm Tree Island, beautiful as a fantasy, but swarming with devils.

Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat nearby, looking up at Dick. Tari knew little of life, but he knew that all the men of Karolin had been swept away by war, leaving the women and the boys defenseless and without a leader.

Then, yesterday, this strange new figure had arrived from the northern sea in a strange boat, with Katafa, the girl who had been blown to sea years ago when out fishing. The women said this strange figure was sent by the gods to be their chief and ruler.

The child knew nothing of the gods, nor did he care. Alone now with this wonderful new person, and out of earshot of his mother, he asked the question direct, with all the simplicity of childhood. "Taori," said little Tari, "who are you?"
