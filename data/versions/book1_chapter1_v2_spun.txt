Here is a modern-style passage:

**The Gates of Morning**

Dick stood on a coral ledge, gazing south. Behind him, the breakers of the outer sea thundered, sending spindrift flying on the wind. Before him, the calm, blue lagoon of Karolin stretched like an infinite lake, dotted with fishing gulls. This was his territory, his to protect, and it was a responsibility he had only recently taken on.

The people of Karolin, busy on the beach, were his people now. Women, children, and youths fished with nets, played games, or worked on paraka patches. The canoes on the sand were his, and the empty houses where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers were also under his care.

As he looked out at the lagoon, and he turned his back to it, facing the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond the sea line, unseen, lay Palm Tree Island, beautiful but swarming with devils.

Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat nearby, looking up at Dick. Tari knew that the men of Karolin had been swept away by war, leaving the women and children defenseless and without a leader.

Dick had arrived yesterday, sent by the gods, so the women said, to be their ruler. The child didn't know who the gods were, but he asked Dick directly, with the simplicity of childhood, "Who are you?"

Dick couldn't answer, couldn't explain how he came from people beyond their world, how he was left alone with an old sailor on Palm Tree Island, how he grew up to be a boy, how Kearney had taught him to fish and spear, how he had lived with her until the day the men came, cutting down trees, killing and burning. He couldn't tell Tari how he and Katafa had escaped in a small boat, steering towards Karolin, guided by the lagoon light in the sky.

As Dick looked at the questioning child, he saw the past, foggy and blurred, like a dream. The name of Dick had passed from his memory, along with the language he spoke as a child. Only Katafa's arrival on Marua, the sailor Kearney who had brought him up, and the little ships Kearney made for him remained vivid in his mind.

"Who are you?" Tari asked again.

Dick looked down. "I am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?"

The child shrugs. "I don't know." He loses interest, distracted by the cries of other children hauling in a net, and trots away.

Dick's gaze returns to the north, and the child's question stirs up memories. He sees the schooner that had put in to Palm Tree, burning at the hands of Melanesian men. He sees Katafa and himself, making their escape in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to handle. He sees their landing on this beach, yesterday, and the women and children swarming around him, considering him their chief and leader.

As he gazes toward the north, the memory of the men they escaped from stains the beauty of the sea and sky. There's no immediate fear, but Dick knows they'll build canoes, see the lagoon light in the sky, and come. It might take a long time, but they'll come.

Dick's mind is a mix of savagery and civilization. He can think forward, imagine, and envision the danger that lurks beyond the horizon. His passion for Katafa, his other self, is threatened, and he knows that war canoes might be needed to protect her.

Katafa's hand falls on his shoulder, and he turns to face her. Her eyes are fixed on the point where he was gazing. "Look!" she says.

Palm Tree Island begins to appear through the mirage, a mysterious stain in the southern sky, deepening, hardening, until it sketched itself vividly before them.

Their untutored minds, knowing nothing of mirage, gaze at the island, beautiful yet threatening, inhabited by demons. They remember the horde of savages on the beach, the wind that filled the sail as they escaped, the yells of the Melanesians mad with rum, and again, they feel the threat.

Dick's nostrils expand, his eyes grow dark with a mix of hate and love. They had threatened him, nothing; they had threatened her, everything; and they still threatened her. They would come, and he knew it.

Some day, they would build canoes, see the lagoon light, and come. They had no women, and the women of Karolin were a treasure they wouldn't hesitate to take. The danger lay not only in the north but wherever greed, desire, or hatred might roam.

To Dick, there was no world beyond the two islands; no Europe, no America, no history but the history of his short life as the life of Katafa. And yet, even in that life, he had learned to dread men and envision the foundation of all historyâ€”man's instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.

The vision of the island fades, and suddenly vanishes like a light blown out. As they turn from the sea to the lagoon, she points to a canoe approaching from the southern beach. It's the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders, and leaving the coral ledge, they come down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
